# Web Content Q&A Tool Access Instructions

The web application can be accessed through your web browser after starting the application. 

## Local Access
When running the application locally, you can access it at:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Network Access
If you're running the application on a server, you can access it using the server's IP address:
```
http://[server-ip-address]:8000
```

The application provides two main features:
1. Process URLs tab - Where you can submit URLs for content processing
2. Ask Questions tab - Where you can ask questions about the processed content

Note: Make sure port 8000 is open and accessible on your firewall if accessing from another machine.
